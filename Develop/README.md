  ## Installation
  
  To "install" this application you will need to clone this repository using your terminal (git clone).  You will then need Node.js installed onto your computer.  You can find it here (https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).  You will also need inquirer  Version  8.2.4.  You can  run  npm i inquirer@8.2.4  in your main directory to install. 


  ## Usage

  The main intent of this application is to create a README.  To start this make sure you have the necessary dependancies from the install section.  Once you complete that section you can then begin to run the application as it is fairly simple.  Run *node index.js* in your terminal and then you will be prompted with a series of questions.  Fill them out to your liking and then press enter.  You should then have a README file generated within your main directory.  You can then edit this from there or leave it as you made it!  The world is yours.  If you like visual aid here is a video demonstrating the usage of the application.
